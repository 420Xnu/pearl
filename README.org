* pearl

GNU/Linux on Apple M1-based hardware, including, in particular, a MacBook Pro called "pearl". No relationship to [[https://www.perl.com][Perl]], though we do use that.

Ideally, this repository will contain everything you need to build and run Debian GNU/Linux on any M1 machine.

Still in the very early stages.
